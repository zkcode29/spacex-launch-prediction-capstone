# Model Performance Comparison

This document provides a detailed comparison of the machine learning models trained to predict Falcon 9 first stage landing success.

## Evaluation Metrics

The following metrics were used to assess model performance on the unseen test dataset:

| Model                  | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
| ---------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| **Logistic Regression**| 0.00     | 0.00      | 0.00   | 0.00     |
| **Decision Tree**      | 0.00     | 0.00      | 0.00   | 0.00     |
| **Random Forest**      | 0.00     | 0.00      | 0.00   | 0.00     |
| **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** | 0.00     | 0.00      | 0.00   | 0.00     |

## Analysis

- **Logistic Regression:** Serves as a good baseline model. Its performance indicates...
- **Decision Tree:** This model provided... It might be prone to overfitting, as seen by...
- **Random Forest:** As an ensemble method, it improved upon the single Decision Tree by...
- **SVM:** The SVM model performed...

## Best Model Selection

Based on the evaluation metrics, the **[Your Best Model, e.g., Random Forest]** was selected as the final model for this project. It demonstrated the best balance of [e.g., precision and recall] and achieved the highest F1-Score, making it the most reliable predictor of landing success among the models tested.
