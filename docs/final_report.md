# Final Report: SpaceX First Stage Landing Prediction

## Executive Summary

SpaceX has revolutionized the space industry by successfully reusing the first stage of its Falcon 9 rockets, drastically reducing the cost of launches. This project aimed to determine if we could predict the success of a first stage landing based on publicly available launch data. By applying data science methodologies, we have successfully built a machine learning model that predicts landing outcomes with a high degree of accuracy.

## Key Questions & Answers

1.  **How do variables like payload mass, launch site, and orbit affect landing success?**
    -   *Finding:* Our analysis shows that payload mass is a significant factor. Heavier payloads are generally associated with a lower probability of successful landing. Certain orbits, like Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO), also present a greater challenge for landings.

2.  **Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years?**
    -   *Finding:* Yes, there is a clear and strong positive trend. As SpaceX gained more experience, the landing success rate has improved dramatically, showcasing a steep learning curve.

3.  **What is the best algorithm for this prediction task?**
    -   *Finding:* After evaluating several classification algorithms, the **[Your Best Model, e.g., Random Forest]** model provided the best performance, achieving an accuracy of **[Your Best Accuracy, e.g., 92%]** on the test data.

## Business Value

The predictive model developed in this project can be used to estimate the financial cost and risk associated with a future Falcon 9 launch. By predicting whether the first stage can be recovered, stakeholders can better forecast launch costs and operational planning.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the power of machine learning in the aerospace industry. The findings confirm known operational challenges and highlight the impressive improvements made by SpaceX over time. The final model serves as a reliable tool for predicting first stage landing success.
